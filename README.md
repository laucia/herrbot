# herrbot
A twitterbot that phonetically translates from english to german

## Principle

Mentions the twitter bot either directly to have your message "germanified", or in a conversation, to have the original message "germanified".

## Sample Output

```
What is the meaning of life?
```

becomes

```
wat is de miehning awe lahiv?
```

## See it live

talk with this silly thing on twitter [@herrbot_de](https://twitter.com/herrbot_DE/with_replies)
